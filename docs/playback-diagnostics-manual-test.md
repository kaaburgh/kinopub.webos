# Playback Diagnostics Manual Test Checklist

Use this checklist on an LG webOS TV after installing a build that includes the playback diagnostics overlay.

## Open And Close

- Start normal playback.
- Open player settings with the Blue button or ArrowUp.
- Select `Диагностика воспроизведения`.
- Confirm the overlay appears above the video.
- Press Back and confirm the overlay closes.
- Open and close the overlay repeatedly.
- Confirm playback continues and the UI remains responsive.

## Normal Playback

- Let a video play for several minutes.
- Confirm playback time and duration update about once per second.
- Confirm `paused`, `seeking`, `readyState`, and `networkState` are readable.
- Confirm recent video events appear in the history.
- Confirm buffered ranges and buffer ahead are shown.

## Pause And Resume

- Pause playback while the overlay is visible.
- Confirm `paused: true`.
- Resume playback.
- Confirm `paused: false`.
- Confirm the overlay remains readable and does not block playback.

## Seek

- Seek forward.
- Confirm `seeking` and `seeked` events appear.
- Confirm buffer state updates after the seek.
- Confirm the overlay clearly indicates if the current position is not buffered.

## Fixed-Quality Playback

- Select a fixed quality from the player settings.
- Reopen diagnostics.
- Confirm HLS level state shows fixed mode when HLS.js exposes enough information.
- Confirm no unexpected automatic quality or source behavior changed.

## Adaptive HLS Playback

- Play an adaptive/master-playlist stream when available.
- Confirm HLS.js is shown as active.
- Confirm available levels are listed compactly.
- Confirm level switches appear as normal diagnostic events.
- Confirm bandwidth estimate is shown when the installed HLS.js runtime exposes it.

## Segment Pipeline

- While playback runs normally, confirm the `Segment Pipeline` section alternates between `load: ... loading`
  and `load: ... loaded in Ns`, and similarly for `append`, roughly once per fragment.
- Confirm `emergency aborts` stays at `0` during normal playback.
- If a level switch is forced under changing bandwidth, confirm `emergency aborts` increments only when
  HLS.js actually aborts an in-flight fragment load, and that the load stage shows `aborted (low bandwidth)`.

## Network Interruption

- If possible, temporarily interrupt network connectivity.
- Confirm the overlay records HLS errors such as load timeout, manifest failure, fragment failure, or HTTP status.
- Confirm the `Failure Summary` section increments the `network` counter for connectivity/load failures, and
  that `last` reflects the most recent failure category and its age.
- Confirm the `Segment Pipeline` load stage reflects a stalled/retrying fragment load during the interruption
  (elapsed loading time keeps increasing instead of completing).
- Confirm any request location shows hostname only, not full URLs or query parameters.
- Restore connectivity and observe whether successful fragment information updates.

## Buffer Starvation

- If reproducible, let playback stall due to an empty buffer without a network interruption.
- Confirm the `Failure Summary` `buffer starvation` counter increments rather than `media/decode`, since
  hls.js reports buffer-stall symptoms as a media error that this overlay recategorizes using the error
  `details` field.
- Confirm normal `LEVEL_SWITCHED` events during recovery are shown as `level switch` entries in Recent Events
  and are never counted in the Failure Summary.

## Decode Quality

- Check the Decode Quality section.
- If supported, confirm total frames, dropped frames, and dropped percentage update.
- If unsupported on the TV firmware, confirm the overlay shows `not available`.

## Fragment Labelling

- Play a stream with a separate audio track at a quality that is not 1080p (2160p is a good test).
- Confirm `Last Fragment` shows one line per stream — `main: 2160p, …` and `audio: track N, …` —
  and that neither flickers between resolutions.
- Confirm the audio line is never labelled with a video resolution. An audio fragment's `level` is a
  track index, so resolving it against the video levels would name it after an unrelated quality.
- Sanity-check the sizes: a 2160p video fragment is megabytes, an audio fragment a few hundred KB.
- Confirm the load duration and throughput are real numbers rather than `n/a`. They read `n/a` for
  as long as the overlay looked them up under their hls.js 0.x names, which is easy to mistake for
  an idle stream.
- On letterboxed content, confirm a level is named the same way everywhere: if the level list says
  `405p (720x302)`, the fragment and pipeline lines must say `405p` too, not `302p`.
- Confirm `main last successful` tracks the video stream, so it keeps climbing if video stalls while
  audio keeps arriving.

## Audio Track After A Recovery

- Play a title with several audio tracks and select one that is not the first.
- Confirm the `HLS` section shows `selected audio` and `playing audio` agreeing, and that neither is
  highlighted.
- Provoke a media error — the decoder rejecting data, or an audio-track playlist that fails to load.
- Confirm playback resumes **from where it was**, not from the beginning of the film. A jump back to
  the start is the regression this guards: `recoverMediaError()` detaches the media element, and
  hls.js's buffer controller calls `media.load()` on the way out, which resets `currentTime` and
  drops the buffer.
- Confirm the audio track is still the selected one, in the picture and in both diagnostics lines.
  If they disagree the two lines turn yellow, and a capture taken then carries the same mismatch.
- Let a stall run long enough for the watchdog to reload the playlist. If an `audioTrackLoadError`
  follows it, confirm the recovery is now an `audio-track-reselect` in the Sentry breadcrumbs rather
  than a `media-recover`, and that playback continues from where it was. A `media-recover`
  immediately after `watchdog-reload` is the shape this guards against.

## Subtitle Brightness And HDR

- Play an HDR title with subtitles and open the player settings.
- Confirm `Яркость субтитров` now offers 15% and 10% below 25%. On the TV, 25% was both the dimmest
  option and the one chosen as best for HDR, which is the shape of a range that stops too early.
- Pick a value, leave the player, and come back to the same title. The value must be remembered.
- Open a different title and confirm it starts from the default for _its_ dynamic range, then set
  its own. Going back to the first title must restore the first value: a per-title choice outranks
  both defaults, so anything watched twice keeps exactly what was chosen for it.
- For a series, confirm episodes of the same series share one value.
- In the `HLS` section, confirm `video range` reads `PQ` (or `HLG`) on HDR content and `SDR` — or
  `not declared` — otherwise. This is what now selects the brightness default and drives the `HDR`
  badge, so a wrong reading here is a wrong reading everywhere.
- Confirm the `HDR` badge appears on HDR titles and **not** on SDR ones. It used to be a codec guess
  that treated every HEVC stream as HDR; if it now appears on plainly-SDR content, `VIDEO-RANGE` is
  not saying what we think.
- Start an HDR title that has never been opened and confirm subtitles begin at 25% rather than
  needing to be dimmed by hand; start an SDR one and confirm 75%.
- Adjust brightness on an HDR title, then open a _different_ SDR title, and confirm its default did
  not move. The two defaults are stored separately on purpose.
- Note that the range is polled, so on a fresh title the default may settle a second or two into
  playback. Subtitles appearing at the wrong brightness and staying there is a bug; a brief
  adjustment at the very start is expected.
- Confirm the diagnostics panel text is a shade less blinding than before in HDR mode. It is grey
  rather than pure white now, since pure white is what an HDR display maps to peak brightness.

## Overlay Layout

- Open the overlay during normal playback.
- Confirm the left column shows `Playback`, `Buffer`, `Segment Pipeline`, `Decode Quality`.
- Confirm the middle column shows only `Recent Events`, and that it runs from the top of the column
  down to the bottom of the panel rather than stopping after a few entries.
- Confirm the right column shows `HLS`, `Last Fragment`, `Failure Summary`.
- Confirm a `QR` button is visible in the panel header, left of the `Back: закрыть` hint.
- Let several events accumulate and confirm noticeably more of them are visible than before.

## Capture Export

- With the diagnostics panels open, activate the `QR` button in the header (Magic Remote pointer),
  and separately confirm the `Yellow` colour key does the same thing.
- Confirm `Yellow` does nothing when the diagnostics panels are closed.
- Confirm a QR code appears with the caption showing the payload length and `(сжато)`. If it says
  `(без сжатия)`, the TV runtime has no `CompressionStream`; note that, since it roughly doubles the
  code size.
- Confirm a single code is shown for a normal capture; `Часть N из M` labels only appear if the
  payload needed splitting.
- Scan it with a phone camera and confirm it decodes to a text string starting with `KPD2`.
- Run the decoder and confirm the report matches what the overlay showed:

  ```sh
  node scripts/decode-diagnostics.js "<scanned text>"
  ```

- Confirm the decoded event list is newest-first and its timestamps line up with the overlay.
- Press Back and confirm the export view closes back to the diagnostics panels, and that a second
  Back then closes the panels themselves. Playback must be unaffected throughout.
- Open the export again and confirm the QR does not change or flicker while it is on screen (the
  capture is frozen at the moment it was opened).

## Recovery Budget

- Reproduce a segment the CDN refuses (seek into an unbuffered region of a title that has shown
  `HTTP 0` before).
- Watch the `recovery:` line in `Failure Summary`. The attempt count must **climb** — `1/6`, `2/6`,
  … — with the gap between retries growing (1, 2, 4, 8, 8, 8 s).
- Confirm it reaches `gave up after 6, networkError / fragLoadError` within roughly a minute, and
  that `FRAG_LOADING` events then stop entirely.
- A count that sits at `1/6` while the `network` failure counter keeps climbing is the regression
  this guards against: recovery restarting the loading engine refetches the init segment, and
  counting that as proof of recovery refills the budget forever. `src/utils/hlsRecovery.test.ts`
  covers the rule.
- Confirm that once playback genuinely resumes, a later unrelated failure starts again from `1/6`
  rather than inheriting the spent budget.

## Watchdog Reload Restarts From Empty

- Start a title, seek forward so there is a gap, and let content buffer on both sides of it.
- Note the `ranges` line in the `Buffer` section — it should show two ranges.
- Provoke a stall long enough for the watchdog to escalate to `watchdog-reload`.
- Expect the buffered ranges to be **gone** afterwards, rebuilding from the play position. This is
  not a defect to report: `loadSource()` triggers `BUFFER_RESET` in this hls.js version and the
  SourceBuffers are removed. It is recorded here so the cost of the reload is visible when judging
  whether that escalation is worth keeping.
- Confirm playback does resume from where it stalled rather than from the beginning — the watchdog
  passes the position to `startLoad()`, which matters because `onManifestLoading` resets hls.js's
  own start position to zero.

## Decode Health Indicator

- During clean playback, confirm no badge is shown at the top left.
- On content that stutters, confirm a badge appears below the title row reading
  `Пропуск кадров N%`, yellow from 1% and red from 5%.
- Confirm it disappears again once playback is clean for the length of the window (30 s).
- Confirm the badge is hidden while the diagnostics overlay or the QR export is open.
- Confirm it never intercepts the remote: pressing directions/OK must behave exactly as without it.
- If a decoder error occurs, confirm the badge reads `Ошибки декодера ×N` instead, and that the
  `media/decode` counter in `Failure Summary` moves by the same amount — the two read the same
  categorisation and must agree.

## Playback Failure Notice

- Reproduce a segment the CDN refuses and let the failure run all the way out — roughly a minute for
  the fatal-error budget, then the watchdog's three playlist reloads.
- Confirm nothing appears while `recovery:` in `Failure Summary` still shows `retry N/6` or the
  watchdog is still counting: a notice during a recovery that might still work is a bug.
- Reproduce the other shape too — a stall that produces only non-fatal errors, where hls.js never
  escalates and the watchdog is the only thing recovering. The notice must still appear once the
  watchdog gives up. This is the failure the watchdog exists for, and a rule that also demanded a
  spent fatal budget would never show anything here.
- Once recovery reads `gave up …`, confirm a centred panel appears reading
  `Воспроизведение остановлено`, with the reason underneath and a `Повторить` button.
- Confirm the button is focused: press OK without moving the pointer and the retry must fire.
- Confirm the arrow keys and OK behave normally everywhere else — the panel must not swallow presses
  meant for the player.
- Press `Повторить`. Playback must restart **from where it froze**, not from the beginning, and the
  notice must disappear immediately rather than lingering until the next poll.
- If the retry cannot succeed either, confirm the notice takes as long to come back as it did the
  first time — roughly a minute of visible retries in `recovery:`, not a few seconds. Reappearing
  almost immediately means the rebuilt pipeline inherited the previous attempt's spent watchdog
  budget instead of getting a fresh one.
- Open the settings popup, the episode picker, and the diagnostics overlay in turn while the notice
  is up. Each must hide it, and closing them must bring it back.
- Press Back with the notice on screen and confirm it leaves the player at once.
- On a source played without HLS.js (`is_hls.js_active` off, or an `http` streaming type), confirm a
  file the TV cannot decode shows `Телевизор не смог воспроизвести этот файл.` instead.

## Recovery Episodes In Sentry

- Reproduce a stall, then let it run to completion rather than restarting playback.
- In Sentry, find the `playback: recovered …` or `playback: recovery abandoned …` event.
- Reproduce a wedge that keeps `readyState` below `HAVE_FUTURE_DATA` while hls.js continues to emit
  non-fatal errors. Let it persist beyond the watchdog's 8 s threshold, then confirm one event is
  eventually produced even if no fatal error or recovery action occurs. Its
  `playback_episode_trigger` must be `persistent-wedge`.
- Confirm its breadcrumbs show the whole chain in order: the episode start, each fatal error, each
  `fatal-retry` with its attempt number and delay, any `watchdog-restart` / `watchdog-reload`, and
  the budget-exhausted entries.
- Confirm the non-fatal error flood appears as periodic `N non-fatal errors` summaries rather than
  hundreds of individual breadcrumbs, and that `errorCounts` in the event context still totals them
  all.
- For a recovered episode, confirm the `playback_recovered_after` tag names the action that came
  last — this is what says which recovery path works.
- Confirm exactly one event is sent per episode, not one per error.
- Confirm the persistent-wedge event carries `playback_id`, selected quality and HLS level state,
  ready/network state, seeking, buffer-ahead duration, buffered-range count, the latest HLS error,
  and recovery/watchdog state. Confirm that exact playback position and absolute buffered ranges are
  absent because they are personal viewing data, and that appends alone do not close the episode
  while the media element remains unplayable.
- Stall a stream, then press Back while recovery is still running. Confirm an event arrives with
  `playback_episode_ended_by: teardown` at `warning` level, carrying the breadcrumbs collected so
  far. Nothing was reported for this case before, so an absent event is the regression.
- Do the same but pick a different episode instead of pressing Back — the player remounts, so this
  must also report `teardown`.
- Let a failure run to the notice and press `Повторить`; confirm the episode closes as
  `manual-retry`, and that whatever happens next is reported as its own episode rather than being
  folded into the first.

## Privacy Check

- Inspect the overlay during HLS errors.
- Confirm no full stream URLs, authorization tokens, cookies, or query parameters are visible.
- Confirm only hostnames are shown for request diagnostics.
- Decode an exported capture taken during an error and confirm the same holds in the decoded text —
  the export must never carry more than the overlay displays.
- Confirm a Sentry event for a playback issue contains hostnames only — no full stream URLs, tokens
  or query parameters in the message, the `playback` context, or the breadcrumbs.
