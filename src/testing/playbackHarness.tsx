/**
 * Mounts the real player against a scripted CDN and gives a test a clock it can wind forward.
 *
 * The component under test is `components/media/media.new`, unmodified: the recovery paths the
 * scenarios exercise are the ones that ship. Only two things are substituted -- the CDN (see
 * `hlsCdn`) and the parts of the browser jsdom does not have (media source, playback progress).
 *
 * Playback has to be simulated because jsdom decodes nothing: `currentTime` never advances on its
 * own and `buffered` is permanently empty, so the stall watchdog would see a frozen picture in
 * every test and fire in all of them. The simulation is driven from what the CDN actually
 * delivered, which keeps it honest -- make the CDN stop serving segments and the buffer stops
 * growing, so playback runs into its end exactly as it did on the TV.
