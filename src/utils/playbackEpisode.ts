/**
 * Tracks a playback *recovery episode* — everything between the first fatal/recovery signal or
 * persistent wedge and the moment playback either resumes or is given up on — so the whole chain
 * reaches Sentry as one report.
 *
 * The motivating question is "does the stall watchdog's playlist reload actually rescue playback?"
 * A single error report cannot answer it, because the answer is in what happens afterwards. So each
 * recovery step is recorded as a breadcrumb, and one event is sent when the episode concludes,
 * carrying the outcome and the trail that led to it.
 *
 * The hard constraint is volume. The failure this project has been chasing emits roughly three
 * errors a second; breadcrumbing each one would fill Sentry's 100-entry buffer in about half a
 * minute and evict exactly the early context that explains the episode. Repeated errors are
 * therefore counted and summarised on a timer, while the rare, meaningful steps — a fatal error, a
 * persistent wedge, a recovery action, or a budget running out — are recorded individually.
